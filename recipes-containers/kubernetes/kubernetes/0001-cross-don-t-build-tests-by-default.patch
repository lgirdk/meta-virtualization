Subject: [PATCH] cross: don't build tests by default

The hack/* build infrastructure doesn't respect the WHAT= commands
that the make infrastructure provides to limit what is built.

In our case, we are cross building and can't build the server test
components without error. As such, we patch the targets out of the
script to allow a successful build.
